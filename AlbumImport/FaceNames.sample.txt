//This file contains the names of the faces.
//Faces are identified by the order in this file. So IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INSERT OR DELETE LINES!
//You can 'delete' lines by writing DELETED in it. You can also re-use lines by simply overwriting them.
//
//Lines starting with // or with a # are treated as comment
